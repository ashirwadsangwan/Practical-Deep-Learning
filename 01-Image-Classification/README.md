<p>This post is about first lecture of [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course and the lecture where Jeremy starts with explaining about the `fastai` library and then created a image classifier for mixed breeds of dogs and cats. So, lets jump in and start creating stuff.</p>
<p>Let's first import the fastai library and fastai vision library which contains all pre-trained models and all the needed libraries for this project.</p>
```python

from fastai import *
from fastai.vision import *
```
